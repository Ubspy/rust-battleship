The following is based on chat logs in a Discord channel we used to clock
in or out. We lost some information due to figuring out that the precise
timestamp of messages does not show after two days; after figuring this out,
we included the clock-in times and clock-out times in our messages. This is
a pretty accurate account of the amount of time we spent.
